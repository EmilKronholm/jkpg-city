                <h4>Welcome to JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping City!</h4>
                <p>This website was created by Emil Kronholm as a school project for the great course
                    Web Development - Advanced Concepts, held by Patrick Riehmann at JTH in JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping.
                    The course focuses on theoretical in depth concepts such as web history, cookies, event propagation and rendering.
                    And combined we will also work with low-level native technologies (e.g. no frontend frameworks, just using DOM-manipulation).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This website is static and is completely rendered on client side using REST-API (with JWT
                    authentication) for dynamic content.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The webserver is static and hosted with nginx. It's optimized for static websites, event-driven and
                    as a result; extremely fast.
                    And by custom config, we can still have protected routes with built in authentication.
                    We can also very easily structure our project however we'd like (e.g. using seperate folders and subfolders for HTML/CSS-files,
                    which isn't always straight forward on static webservers) using the try_files keyword.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We're only using CSR for dynamic content (a requirement for the course) which honestly I've
                    had a bad experience with during this project. Although it has it's use cases,
                    I feel like development is just slower and more messy. This means however i will always appreciate
                    frameworks/tools much more in future ðŸ˜‰

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The backend is a REST-API built with node.js and express combined with the best database engine
                    postgreSQL.
                    We are again working modular, splitting sub-apps into routers, and using dedicated services to complete
                    low-level database logic (if you can call pg low-level ðŸ˜…).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What I have taken away from this project:<br>
                    - Complex Native DOM-manipulation is slow to develop (should be avoided?) <br>
                    - For any serious project, consider not writing SQL statements in JS strings ðŸŽ‰<br>
                    - Always try to think twice before taking a shortcut ðŸ«¡<br>
                    - Nginx is an amazing technology ðŸ‘Œ<br>
